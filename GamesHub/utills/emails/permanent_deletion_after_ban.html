    <p><b>Dear {{ username }},</b></p>

    <p>
      We are writing to inform you that your account has been 
      <strong>permanently deleted</strong> from our platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      This action was taken due to repeated violations of our community guidelines 
      associated with the following content type:
      <strong>{{ content_type_model }}</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      As outlined in our policy, accounts that receive more than 
      <strong>two bans</strong> are subject to permanent removal. 
      Since this threshold has been exceeded, your account and all associated data 
      have now been deleted and cannot be restored.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you believe this action was taken in error or require clarification, 
      you may contact our support team. However, please note that account 
      restoration is not possible once deletion has been completed.
